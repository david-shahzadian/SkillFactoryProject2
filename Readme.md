**Skill Factory Module 2 Project**

###### Git flow:
master - main release code branch
dev (from master) - develop branch that includes developed and tested code
feature branch (from dev) - branch that includes a new feature code or bug fix code.

###### Scheme
master -> dev -> feature branch

###### Feature branch naming conventions.

Feature branch should include the Jira ticket name.
E.G. if ticket name is SF-102 then the branch name should be SF-102.
This is necessary for Jira to subscribe to commit, PR etc.
